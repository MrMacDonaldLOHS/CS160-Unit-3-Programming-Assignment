## CS 160 – Assignment 01

This is your first programming assignment in this class. Programming assignments are worth a larger percentage of your grade than the prior assignments you've done. However, that does not mean they are more difficult. Think of them like a unit test. You are demonstrating that you have learned the lessons in this unit.

**Like a unit test, you are to do this project on your own. (See the academic integrity policy at the end of these instructions).**

For this assignment, you will use the patterns from the earlier replits. It is an opportunity to show off your creativity because you get to decide what you will do! Remember, all students are at different levels in the class - don’t compare yourself with other students - be proud of your creation!


### Problem Description



1. Write an interactive application in Python to get input from the user, do some calculation, and output the results to the user. 
2. The program should start with a welcoming message, and finish with a goodbye message (see the example below)
3. **You must use constants to replace any magic numbers.**


### Here are some ideas to get you started:

1. Any measurement conversions - meters to kms, or grams to kg etc. (You cannot use ounces to cups since we just did that, but your code can be very similar)
2. Any calculation involving money - tax rates, loans, interest rates, tuition increases etc.
3. Any calculation involving speed, distance, and time.

### Example Run (User input is in `Red`)
Welcome to my ounces to cups conversion program.

How many ounces does the recipe need? `23`

That is 2 cups, 7 ounces.

Thank you for using my ounces to cups conversion program!

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- You have put the parenthesis after the input command `()`
- You have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have used the **+** symbol to concatenate (join).
- All of your indentation is correct.
- You concatenated numbers using `str(number)`
- You remembered to convert the `input` using `int()` or `float()`

### Academic Integrity:

As a reminder, learning to code can be difficult and frustrating and takes LOTS of practice. Our academic integrity policy for this course states that when completing programming assignments you may:



* review course materials
* look things up in the Python documentation
* google specific questions online, such as "syntax for Python while loops"
* use the sample program as a starting idea only - you must start with a blank algorithmic design planning document and Python file

You may NOT, under any circumstances, begin a programming assignment by:



* looking for completed code which you can then modify
* starting with a copy of the actual sample program and modify
* asking a more experienced friend or family member to outline a solution for you

The only way to learn to code is to do it yourself. The assignments will be built from examples during the lectures, so ask for clarification during class if something seems confusing. If you start with code from another source and change the variable names or other content to make it look original, you will receive a zero on the assignment.

I may ask you to explain your assignment verbally. If you cannot satisfactorily explain what your code does, and answer questions about why you wrote it in a particular way, then you should also expect a zero.
